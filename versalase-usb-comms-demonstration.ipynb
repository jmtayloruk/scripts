    "# Demonstration of USB communication with the Versalase laser\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates communication with the Stradus Versalase laser over a USB link. The underlying text protocol is documented (described for RS232 comms) in section 9 of the manufacturer's Stradus Versalase™ User Manual supplied with the laser. However there is no documentation on how to communicate with it over USB (except using their own Windows GUI program). I reverse-engineered the protocol (details at https://jmtayloruk.github.io/tools/2024/07/06/reverse-engineering-laser-control/), and this notebook implements the protocol in Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## To install pyusb support to run the Python code in this notebook\n",
    "`brew install libusb`\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install pyusb`\n",
    "\n",
    "For M1 suport for libusb, run the following (see https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb/issues/355)\n",
    "`ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib/libusb-1.0.0.dylib //usr/local/lib/libusb.dylib`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other optional notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing this in C/Cocoa code on OS X\n",
    "If I do want to eventually implement this in C/Cocoa code, the relevant information is here \n",
    "https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeviceDrivers/Conceptual/USBBook/USBDeviceInterfaces/USBDevInterfaces.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002645-TPXREF101\n",
    "It looks like this code is actually quite close to what I need, so it shouldn’t be too much of a faff to code this. \n",
    "\n",
    "### To run Wireshark on OS X (not necessary, but included here as a reminder to myself)\n",
    "To access the USB interface you need to run\n",
    "`sudo ifconfig XHC20 up`\n",
    "\n",
    "For that to work on 10.13 or up, you need to disable system integrity protection: cmd-R to restart in recovery mode, launch terminal, type `csrutil disable` (from https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016462-CH5-SW1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the protocol?\n",
    "\n",
    "I don’t think it’s a FTDI usb/serial adaptor - that seems to send different packets over the USB link, including (from my recollection…) ones over the bulk in/out endpoints.\n",
    "Neither is it USBTMC (Richard Bowman’s suggestion). That too does data transfers over bulk in/out endpoints (which we don't see here). Indeed, FTDI could well be using that exact protocol (I didn't look). It's not HID as I do not see \"boot\" messages being sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not show up as a COM port (or indeed any kind of device, as far as I can see) in the Windows Device Manager."
